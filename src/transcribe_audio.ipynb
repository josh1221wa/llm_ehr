       "{'text': \" Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi. Um, should we stop? Yeah. Okay. Hello. Um, the boys are how can I help you this morning? I, um, I've just had some, um, diary for the last three days. Um, and it's been affecting me. I need to stay close to the toilet and, um, yeah, it's been affecting my day to day activities. Yeah. I'm sorry to hear that. Um, and when you say diary, what What do you mean by diary? Do you mean you're going to a toilet more often or are your stools more loose? Yeah, so it's like loose and watery stool going to the toilet quite often and like some pain in my like lower stomach. Okay. And how many times a day are you going? Let's say I've lost a couple of days. Probably like six, seven times a day. Six, seven times a day. And you may have mentioned the main watery. Have you noticed any other things like blood in your stools? No, no blood, yeah just watery and loose still. Okay, and you mentioned you've had some pain in your tummy as well. Yep. Whereabouts is a pain? It's actually in my lower abdomen, so like, yeah just to one side. One side? What side is that? On the left side. Yeah, so I like it. Then can you describe the pain to me? Yeah, it feels like a cramp, like a muscular cramp. crap and yeah I feel a bit weak in shaky. And is it pain, is it there all the time or does it come and go? It comes and goes. Does it pain move anywhere else? For example, twer is your back? No, just mainly my stomach. Okay, fine. And you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak in shaky as well. Would you be more shaky? Do you mean you've been feeling feverish for example? Yeah, it doesn't feel like, yeah, I just made it for a week. I haven't had a fever at the moment, but I did notice a temperature when the symptoms started. So, yeah, around about three or four days ago. You measured your temperature then? Yeah, I didn't measure my temperature, no, but I felt just a bit hot. Okay, okay. Any other symptoms like sweating or... No. And any vomiting at all? Yes, so I vomited at the start of the symptoms, but now I've stopped vomiting. You stopped vomiting, okay? And was your vomiting? I know it's not nice we've talked about, but was it just normal food colour? Yeah, just normal vomit. And there was no blood in your vomit. Is that right? No, no. And any other symptoms at all? So you mentioned tummy pain, you mentioned diarrhea, you mentioned vomiting. anything else that comes to mind? I had a loss of appetite. I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids. Okay, so you're drinking fluids. What kind of foods have you managed to eat, please? Just soups and, yeah, light foods, like smoothies and, yeah, liquid foods mainly. Okay, fine. And so, they started just three days ago to symptoms. Are you aware of any triggers which may have caused the symptoms to kick on? So for example, things like takeaway foods or eating out or being around other people who would sing the symptoms? Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, but other than that, I've been eating normally I think unusual, yeah. Do you remember where you ate? Yeah, I ate a Chinese restaurant with friends. Okay. Anyone else on well with similar symptoms? So no one else in the family, so I've wiped in two kids and one child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms. Okay, okay. Fine. Right. And in terms of your overall health, Are you normally fissing well? Yeah, I mean, other than asthma, I'm using inhaler, everything else is fine. Okay. And did you ask them a well controlled? Yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler and that's under control. And you don't have any other tummy problem, bowel problem, that should be aware of? No. No, okay. And pardon the inhalers, do you take any other medications? No, no other medications. Okay, fine. In terms of just all your data to their life, you said it's been affecting your life. Yeah. In what way has it been affecting your life? So I need to stay close to the toilet because I go quite frequently during these past three days. Okay. Yeah, other than that, it's the main concern. And are you currently working at the moment? I work. Yeah, I work. Working at work. I'm in the countenance. Okay, have you been going to work last three days? Are you going to home? Yeah, I've been going to work. Okay. I must be difficult for you then. Yeah, it's been quite difficult. Right. And you said you mentioned you live with a wife and two children, is that right? Yes, yeah. All right. Just a couple of other questions we need to ask. Do you smoke at all? No, I don't smoke. Do you drink much in a way of alcohol? No, I don't drink alcohol though. Okay. So, normally at this stage, I like to... examine you, but haven't listened to your stories. Just recap, for the last three days, you've been having a loose stool diarrhea, a bit of tummy pain, mainly on the left hand side, vomiting and feeling quite weak and ethargic. You mentioned you haven't just tried to take away as well, three days ago, and I wonder whether that might be the cause of your problems. It seems like you may have something called gastroenteritis, which essentially the tummy bug or infection of your tummy mainly caused by viruses but it can be a possibility of bacteria causing symptoms. At this stage what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management so I don't think you need any antibersics is really just making sure your world hydrated for drinking fluids. There are things like dire light you can get from the pharmacy, which it helps replenish some of your minerals and vitamins. If you are having vomiting and diarrhea, I would recommend that in the first couple of days. If you are feeling feverish and weak, taking some paracetamol, a few tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help. I was certainly going to advise you to take some time to work, actually. I know you're quite keen to work. I would say next two to three days, a chinklier from your system, takes some time off and rest. If your symptoms haven't got better in three to four days, I'll write it down back in senior again. Okay, sure. Because if it is ongoing, then we have to wonder whether something else could be symptoms. Yeah. And we may need to do further tinnus, like taking a sample of your stool, so we can test that, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah, sure, yeah. How's that sound? That sounds great, yeah. Do you have any questions for me? No, no further questions. Okay. Is the treatment plan clear? Yeah, yeah, that's very clear. Thank you. Great. I wish you all the best. Okay. Thank you. Bye.\",\n",
